# **zcleaning-app**
## Repository Overview
This project is a Node.js/Express application for managing cleaning service appointments and clients. Some parts of the scheduling system were created with AI assistance, particularly the calendar generation and drag‑and‑drop functionality.

## Key Components
- **Server entry point** (server.js)  
Initializes environment settings and Passport configuration, sets up middleware (EJS layout engine, session handling with connect-pg-simple, Passport, and flash messages), mounts routers, defines 404/500 handlers, and starts the server on the configured port.

- **Configuration** (src/config)
    1. db.js: Configures a PostgreSQL connection pool using environment variables.
    2. passport.js: Sets up the Google OAuth strategy, including user serialization/deserialization for sessions.

- **Models** (src/models)  
Provides database access logic for users, clients, addresses, appointments, and payments. For example, clients-model.js contains methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting clients, along with payment queries.

- **Controllers** (src/controllers)  
Implements request handling logic.

    1. clients-controller.js: Manages adding, editing, and deleting clients, and displays payment info.

    2. appointments-controller.js: Handles monthly schedule generation, preview, and saving.

- **Routes** (src/routes)  
Defines Express routes mapped to controller functions.
Example: /clients routes include authentication middleware, validation, and client-related handlers.

- **Middleware** (src/middleware)  
Contains authentication checks and a validation error handler that renders forms with errors when Express Validator fails.

- **Utilities** (src/utils)  
scheduleHelpers.js implements the logic for suggesting weekly and monthly appointments based on client preferences and past history.

- **Views** (src/views)  
EJS templates under layout, partials, and pages form the UI.
Example: dashboard.ejs shows summary cards for clients and appointments.

- **Public Assets** (public/)  
Contains static files like CSS, JavaScript (including drag‑and‑drop code), and images.

## Database Structure
SQL scripts in the sql/ folder define tables for users, clients, addresses, appointments, and client payments.
Example: create_clients.sql defines the clients table with fields for names, contact info, service details, pricing, and rotation settings.


## AI Usage Disclosure
This project was developed with the help of generative AI tools as permitted under the CSE Generative AI Usage Policy.

- **ChatGPT** – Provided step-by-step guidance, explanations, and debugging support throughout the project.
- **OpenAI Codex** – Helped generate code snippets and summarize existing project files, particularly for scheduling logic and calendar functions.
- **GitHub Copilot** – Assisted with code completion, variable naming, structure organization, and generating helpful inline comments.

All AI-generated content was reviewed and modified to suit the specific needs of this application. The logic, design decisions, and final implementation reflect personal understanding and active involvement in all parts of the development process.
